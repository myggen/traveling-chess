Chess-JS-Demo
=============

This is a very simple demonstration of a playable chess board using chess.js and chessboard.js.  

In its initial state it is similar to the ChessboardJS demo on jhlywa/chess.js, except that instead of picking moves randomly from the chess.js generated legal moves list, it takes as input the move made on the chessboard.js by a user, so the main problem it solves is translating moves from chessboard.js to moves for chess.js.
